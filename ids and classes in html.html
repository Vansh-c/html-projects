     <!--  here id tag means "identifier " tag , its used to identify an element which is unique to one element only and cant be
       used for other element -->
       <!-- i can't give " mainBox " id to other div element as same  -->
        <!-- lets understand style by example , say I have 100 elements and i want to give background color as red then I have 2 options like
         I should define style for all those elements one by one which is tedious , instead its better to make " redBg" class
         and all the properties you want to define inside redBg like I want to make my background red ,content white , want to make border of
         2 pixel etc by defining all these thing I will add it in redbg class and this redbg class whichever element I will give that
         element will acquire the propertues of redBg class-->

         <!-- remenber that class can only be assigned to multiple element -->

    <!-- lets see power of emmet  -->
     <!-- write span.redbg and press enter similarly type span#mainbox abd press enter -->

     <span class="redbg"></span>
     <span id="mainbox"></span> 
        <!-- try typing this " div.redbg.blackborder.anotherclass" and press enter -->
        <div class="redbg blackborder anotherclass"></div>  

        <!-- note that emmet takes div as default so on typing ".blackbackground" and pressing enter we get our result -->
         <div class="blackbackground"></div>
