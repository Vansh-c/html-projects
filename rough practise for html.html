<!-- javascript is a  scripting language, scripting language means how to automate task on both hardware and software basis -->
 <!-- javascript is often written inside <script> tag  -->

<!-- example 1: to demonstrate a  common example of javascript program -->

<script>                                            // script tag is used to write javascript content inside
    console.log('hello, my name is Vansh Joshi')            // console.log() is used to  print command inside javascript 

    // try running this code, you will see white  page but to see what's really happening try to inspect that  given webpage
    //  to inspect it , double click on your laptop's touchpad  and click inspect and  after wards go into console option on upper left corner of dialogue box which will appear


  // let's us see about strings here string is often written inside quotation marks below is example

  console.log('this is a string')
  console.log('this is a string ' + ' which is made by Vansh Joshi')          // this is how one can add two strings ,this  process is also known as 'concatenation of strings'

console.log(a)         // simply inspect this in browser 

a = 'Vansh'                   // herer value of a is changed to Vansh
console.log(a)               

console.log(a + ' joshi')      // here we added two strings (jo cheeze do apostrophe ke beech mein likhi jae wo string hai) 


// use of let keyword

console.log(a)

//b = 'Vansh'                     // uncomment this two lines , if your uncomment and run in browser you will not find error because it works only if one has block knowlege in javascript regarding let , var and const
// console.log(a)                   // ye error dega kyunki hum iski value phirse bada nhi sakte

console.log(b + ' Mahadev')         //  here also we added two strings

// use of const keyword

const c = 'this is a text'

// c = 'this is another text'          // here we tried changing this  text but it will give error , try uncommenting this code
// console.log(c)

console.log( c + ' adding some contnt here')       // here humne do strings to joda

// if else statements in javascript

// if else condition wali statement hoti hai , ye condition set karti hai

//  below is example
